#Example:
#Connect to two gopro cameras with given serial numbers and take - simultaneously - pictures
#For the script to work only the correct serial numbers are required
#The images are saved using given core file name, to which camera and image indices are automatically added

#Core file name using which all the subsequent downloaded images will be saved
#camera number and image number will be added automatically, do not include them here

#make sure that the cameras are connected and switched on!
